# Udacity React Nanodegree - Project 1 - My Reads

# Author: Luis Domingos

This project is part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program

## To run the project use:

### `npm install`
* installs all the development dependencies

### `npm run start`
* starts a development server

## Backend

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app

This project was based on React's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
